# Etch-a-Sketch

A browser-based Etch-a-Sketch application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as part of The Odin Project curriculum.

## 🎨 About

This project recreates the classic Etch-a-Sketch toy experience in your web browser. Move your cursor across the grid to create drawings by changing the color of squares you hover over. Perfect for digital doodling and pixel art!

## ✨ Features

- **Interactive Drawing Grid**: Hover over squares to draw
- **Customizable Grid Size**: Adjust the grid dimensions (up to 100x100)
- **Multiple Drawing Modes**:
  - Classic black drawing
  - Random RGB colors
  - Progressive darkening effect
- **Clear Function**: Reset the grid to start fresh
- **Responsive Design**: Works on various screen sizes
